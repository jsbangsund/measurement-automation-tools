The photoluminescence quenching measurements in this article were performed using the `lockinSweep` function in `experimentController.py`.

`experimentController.py` provides an example GUI that can easily be edited to allow for various experimental input parameters to be controlled when running repetitive tests. In this example, the GUI is configured to run various voltage sweeps on an LED with simultaneous control of an OBIS laser and measurements using a lock-in amplifier.

Also included are example .tsp scripts to automate diode sweeps using Keithley 26XX (2636 or 2604) source measure units (SMUs), and code to control various standard scientific equipment such as Keysight U2722A SMUs, Stanford Research Systems lock-in amplifiers (SR850), and OBIS coherent lasers.
